                <p>Welcome to The G.A.M.E.</p>
                <p>You are entering G.O. Techs Artificial Military Engagement (G.A.M.E.). It was originally designed to test and train soldiers that G.O. Tech supplied the U.S. government. It is now a deadly obstacle course you can brave for cash and prizes.</p>
                <p>Surviving the GAME is a sci fi survival deck builder. In Surviving the GAME you choose to be a Soldier, Biogene, or Cyborg. You then build a deck around that character to best help you survive the obstacles you face. Unlike most deck builders, there is a play area to represent where you are in the GAME. You may move forward or backward by the rules to earn rewards. Like most deck builders, at the end, the one with the most victory points is the winner. Unfortunately only those who live get to count.</p>
