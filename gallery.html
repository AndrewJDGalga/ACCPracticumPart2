                <p>Join a group of fellow adventurers investigating a series of alarming disappearances in Icewind Dale in this single-play D&D escape board game for 2-6 players.</p>
                <p>This harrowing 3-part adventure can be broken into 3 game sessions or played in 1 heroic sitting. Begin by creating your character. Then explore a humble tavern, fight in epic battles against iconic D&D monsters, and embark on a wild chase through the Underdark on the tail of an evil mage and his dangerous cult to unravel the mystery of their dastardly plans.</p>
                <p>The only way to find the missing people and escape the obstacles is to explore rooms, complete puzzles, and gather clues to solve the mystery at the end of each act.</p>

                <p>Welcome to The G.A.M.E.</p>
                <p>You are entering G.O. Techs Artificial Military Engagement (G.A.M.E.). It was originally designed to test and train soldiers that G.O. Tech supplied the U.S. government. It is now a deadly obstacle course you can brave for cash and prizes.</p>
                <p>Surviving the GAME is a sci fi survival deck builder. In Surviving the GAME you choose to be a Soldier, Biogene, or Cyborg. You then build a deck around that character to best help you survive the obstacles you face. Unlike most deck builders, there is a play area to represent where you are in the GAME. You may move forward or backward by the rules to earn rewards. Like most deck builders, at the end, the one with the most victory points is the winner. Unfortunately only those who live get to count.</p>

                <p>Every game starts with a different, randomized group of Neighbors, each with their own distinct tastes (and sometimes their own agendas). At the start of your turn, you must choose to be Home or Away, giving you access to a different set of actions that you can perform. While Home, you can gain points and abilities by playing cards onto your yard and swaying Neighbors to your side. While Away, you can earn money and get new cards from a shared Store, but you leave your yard vulnerable to your rival’s mischief. When the last Neighbor has been swayed, the game ends, and whoever has the most points wins.</p>
